Welcome to the first section of the course. In this section, you will start learning the very basics of the JavaScript language. So things like variables, data types, operators, if-else statements, and more. So in this part, we will not yet start building beautiful user interfaces. We will do that later of course, but first, we need to focus on the language fundamentals. And so, these lectures are designed for you to learn these fundamentals and to give you an overview of the language, before we actually dive deeper in later sections. Okay, so let's go start this journey right now.
